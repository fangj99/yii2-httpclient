## Installing an extension

In order to install extension use Composer. Either run
                                            
```
composer require --prefer-dist yiisoft/yii2-httpclient "*"
```

or add

```json
"yiisoft/yii2-httpclient": "*"
```
to the `require` section of your composer.json.


then run "composer update" in the right click menu on windows, maybe need composer token from github if your system need update.
